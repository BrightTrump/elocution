            I had a session with Mrs. Deliverance Usimi Alerubo (Kofi) for few
            months, she taught me how to speak the British accent. It was a
            pretty tough ride for me though because i am a Nigerian and i have
            never been to the United Kingdom before but i know i will be there
            someday. She was very kind and generous enough to show me exactly
            how to pronounce some words the way it should be. So, few months
            down the line i was able to practice so much and could speak much
            better than before. I want to say thank you to Miss. Bright and K.D
            Ventures, School of Elocution for bringing out the best in me. I am
            also recommending to the public that this is where you will get
            trained and get results. Excellent atmosphere which is created in
            the process of learning.
